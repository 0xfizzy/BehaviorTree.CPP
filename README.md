# About this library

This  __C++__ library provides a framework to create BehaviorTrees.
It was designed to be flexible, easy to use and fast.

Even if our main use-case is __robotics__, you can use this library to build
__AI for games__, or to replace Finite State Machines in you application.

__BehaviorTree.CPP__ has many interesting features, when compared to other implementations:

- It makes asynchronous Actions, i.e. non-blocking, a first-class citizen.
- It allows the creation of trees at run-time, using a textual representation (XML).
- You can link staticaly you custom TreeNodes or convert them into plugins 
which are loaded at run-time.
- It includes a __logging/profiling__ infrastructure that allows the user 
to visualize, record, replay and analyze state transitions.

Aknowledgement
------------
This library is the result of the join effort between **Eurecat** (main autjor, Davide Faconti) and the
**Italian Institute of Technology** (Michele Colledanchise).

It is one of the main components of [MOOD2Be](https://eurecat.org/es/portfolio-items/mood2be/),
and it is developed at [Eurecat](https://eurecat.org) by Davide Faconti.

MOOD2Be is one of the six **Integrated Technical Projects (ITPs)** selected from the 
[RobMoSys first open call](https://robmosys.eu/itp/) and it received funding from the European
Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme.
